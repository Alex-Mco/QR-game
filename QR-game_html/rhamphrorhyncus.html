                    In the Triassic period, the first vertebrate animals took flight. 
                    While many animals have evolved to glide, pterosaurs like Eudimorphodon 
                    and Austriadraco were among the first vertebrates capable of true, 
                    powered flight. Flight has only evolved 4 times in the history of life 
                    â€“ insects, pterosaurs, birds, and bats.
