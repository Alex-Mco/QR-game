                    While evolution has trends driven by natural selection, it is caused 
                    by random mutation. An individual animal may have beneficial or harmful 
                    mutations, which will affect its chances of survival and reproduction.
                    <br><br>Tap Evolve to see what random mutations affect your animal!
