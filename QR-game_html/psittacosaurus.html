                    Dinosaurs are ancestrally two-legged (bipedal,) but some large 
                    herbivores evolved to move on four legs (quadrupedal) to support 
                    greater weight. Dinosaurs in the clade marginocephalia, such as 
                    these Psittacosaurus and Pachycephalosaurus are two-legged dinosaurs 
                    related to the famous Triceratops. As these dinosaurs evolved 
                    impressive frills and horns, their heavy headgear forced them into 
                    a quadrupedal stance.
