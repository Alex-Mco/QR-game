                    Many groups of vertebrate animals have evolved from terrestrial forms 
                    to become partially or fully aquatic. Animals like whales and dolphins 
                    are descended from land dwelling mammals, which is why they lack gills 
                    and must return to the surface for air. While many people think mosasaurs 
                    are dinosaurs, they are actually giant, aquatic lizards!
