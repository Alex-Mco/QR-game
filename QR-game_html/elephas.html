                    Island Rule states how animals change in response to being isolated 
                    in island environments. Small animals evolve larger on islands when 
                    isolated from their predators. Many flying animals also become 
                    flightless to conserve energy. New Zealand’s Kākāpō, the world’s 
                    only flightless parrot, or the extinct dodo bird are examples of 
                    this. In contrast, large animals evolve smaller in response to 
                    limited food supply. This specimen of a dwarf Elephas native to Sicily and Malta
                    shows a large bodied animal that has evolved smaller due to Island Rule.
