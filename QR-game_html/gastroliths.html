                    Plants are an abundant food source, but they are difficult to digest. 
                    Unlike animals, plants have tough cellular walls. Many have evolved 
                    defenses such as thorns and poison to deter animals from eating them. 
                    Grasses have a silica content 10-20 times higher than other dicot plants, 
                    making them highly abrasive and damaging to teeth. Adaptations such as blunt, 
                    grinding teeth; complex stomachs; regurgitation; and swallowing stomach stones 
                    (gastroliths) aid herbivores in breaking down plant material.
