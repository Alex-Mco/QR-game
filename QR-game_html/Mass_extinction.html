                    Mass extinction events are when a majority of biodiversity on Earth is lost. 
                    In each of the “Big Five” mass extinctions, 70-90% of all animal species perished. 
                    Animals that survive tend to be small, weighing less than 55 pounds, or have low metabolic 
                    rates that enable them to survive extended periods of time without food. For example some living 
                    crocodilians, whose ancestors survived the end-Cretaceous mass extinction, only need to eat once a year.
