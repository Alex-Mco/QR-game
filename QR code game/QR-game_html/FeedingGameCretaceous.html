                    Time to feed! Flowering plants and pollinating insects have evolved and formed close 
                    symbiotic relationships, providing a rich variety of nutrient dense fruits. Some of 
                    the fruits dinosaurs ate are still around today, including figs and grapes!

                    As a small carnivore, you are highly specialized to hunt other small prey.

                <p id="mediumCarnivore" class="hide">
                    As a medium carnivore, you are best adapted to hunt smaller prey or prey 
                    your own size. While you may use pack hunting or ambush to bring down prey 
                    larger than yourself, it is difficult and dangerous.

                <p id="largeCarnivore" class="hide">
                    As a large carnivore, you are best adapted to hunt other large animals. 
                    Small prey is nimble and difficult to catch, while colossal prey is too 
                    formidable to risk.
                </p>
                <p id="colossalCarnivore" class="hide">
                    As a colossal carnivore, you prefer to feed on a wide array of smaller 
                    animals. While you are capable of bringing down any animal, colossal prey 
                    is usually not worth the risk. This feeding strategy is taken to the extreme 
                    in baleen whales â€“ the largest animal on Earth is sustained by eating billions 
                    of tiny krill.
