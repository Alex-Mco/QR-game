                    Many animals have evolved the ability to run only on their back legs,
                     allowing them to move much faster, at the cost of stability. Animals 
                     that can move on their back legs are called bipedal. Some animals are 
                     “obligate bipeds,” meaning they move on two legs at all times, while 
                     others are “facultative bipeds,” walking on four legs, but running 
                     on two legs when extra speed is needed.
