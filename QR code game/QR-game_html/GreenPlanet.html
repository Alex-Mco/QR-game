                    Plants are an abundant food source, but they are difficult to digest. 
                    Unlike animals, plants have thick cellular walls. Many have evolved 
                    defenses, such as thorns and poison, to deter animals from eating them. 
                    Even unassuming plants, like grasses, have a silica content 10-20 times 
                    higher than other dicot plants: making them highly abrasive and damaging to teeth.
                     Adaptations such as blunt, grinding teeth; complex stomachs; regurgitation; 
                     and swallowing stomach stones (gastroliths) aid herbivores in breaking down tough plant material.
