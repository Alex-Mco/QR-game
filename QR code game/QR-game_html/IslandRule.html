                    Island Rule states how animals change in response to being isolated in 
                    island environments. Small animals evolve larger on islands when isolated 
                    from their predators. Many flying animals also become flightless to conserve 
                    energy. New Zealand’s Kākāpō, the world’s only flightless parrot, or the extinct 
                    dodo bird are examples of this. In contrast, large animals evolve smaller in 
                    response to limited food supply. This specimen of a dwarf <i>Elephas</i> native to 
                    Sicily and Malta shows a large bodied animal that has evolved smaller due to Island Rule.
