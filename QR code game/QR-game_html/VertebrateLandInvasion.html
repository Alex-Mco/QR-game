                    In the late Devonian period, vertebrates such as Tiktaalik and Acanthostega 
                    evolved legs that allowed them to colonize the land. Fish had already evolved 
                    lungs in response to oxygen-depleted ocean conditions and to maintain buoyancy 
                    in the water, but other adaptations such as neck mobility and hard-shelled eggs 
                    were also critical to fully colonizing the new land environments.
